Types of JOIN

1) Cross JOIN or Cartesian Product
This type of JOIN returns the cartesian product of rows from the tables in Join. It will return a table which consists of records which combines each row from the first table with each row of the second table

Following is the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
4	alex
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI

SELECT * FROM 
class CROSS JOIN class_info;

The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	1	DELHI
4	alex	1	DELHI
1	abhi	2	MUMBAI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
4	alex	2	MUMBAI
1	abhi	3	CHENNAI
2	adam	3	CHENNAI
4	alex	3	CHENNAI

cross join will give product of two tables without matching any key.

2) INNER Join or EQUI Join
This is a simple JOIN in which the result is based on matched data as per the equality condition 

Consider a class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI


SELECT * from class INNER JOIN class_info where class.id = class_info.id;
The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI


3) Natural JOIN
Natural Join is a type of Inner join which is based on column having same name and same datatype present in both the tables to be joined.

Here is the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI


SELECT * from class NATURAL JOIN class_info; 

The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	Address
1	abhi	DELHI
2	adam	MUMBAI
3	alex	CHENNAI



4) LEFT Outer Join
The left outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data from the two tables and then the remaining rows of the left table and null from the right table's columns.

Here is the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT

SELECT * FROM class LEFT OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
4	anu	null	null
5	ashish	null	null

5)RIGHT Outer Join
The right outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data from the two tables being joined, then the remaining rows of the right table and null for the remaining left table's columns.

Once again the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT

SELECT * FROM class RIGHT OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
null	null	7	NOIDA
null	null	8	PANIPAT


6)Full Outer Join
The full outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data of two table then remaining rows of both left table and then the right table.

The class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT


SELECT * FROM class FULL OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);


ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
4	anu	null	null
5	ashish	null	null
null	null	7	NOIDA
null	null	8	PANIPAT
