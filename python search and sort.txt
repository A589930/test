==================
What the interpreter does is complex but in a nutshell :

1. Looks at the date/time of your script and checks if there is a .pyc file for your script with a later date than your script; if there is skip stage 
2. Read the script line by line and converts that script into python byte code, and then writes the byte code into a pyc file. If your application has mutiple files it creates a pyc file for every .py file. It is at this stage that syntax errors are generated.
3. Load the first pyc file into memory, and the interpret then executes the file instruction by instruction, it is at this stage Runtime errors are created if your code generates such errors. If neccessary then other pyc files are loaded into memory and executed.

============================
Pickling :

It is used to serilize and deserialize the python objects
Pickling: It is a process where a Python object is converted into a byte stream.
Unpickling: It is the reverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an python object.
Module Interface :

dumps() â€“ This function is called to serialize an object.
loads() â€“ This function is called to de-serialize a data stream.

====================================================
Type of operators in Pyton:
1) Arithmetic operators: Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
+	Addition: adds two operands	x + y
-	Subtraction: subtracts two operands	x - y
*	Multiplication: multiplies two operands	x * y
/	Division (float): divides the first operand by the second	x / y
//	Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second	x // y
%	Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second	x % y

# Examples of Arithmetic Operator 
a = 9
b = 4
  
# Addition of numbers 
add = a + b 
# Subtraction of numbers  
sub = a - b 
# Multiplication of number  
mul = a * b 
# Division(float) of number  
div1 = a / b 
# Division(floor) of number  
div2 = a // b 
# Modulo of both number 
mod = a % b 
  
# print results 
print(add) 
print(sub) 
print(mul) 
print(div1) 
print(div2) 
print(mod) 
Output:

13
5
36
2.25
2
1


2) Relational Operators: Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
>	Greater than: True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
<	Less than: True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
==	Equal to: True if both operands are equal	x == y
!=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
>=	Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y

# Examples of Relational Operators 
a = 13
b = 33
  
# a > b is False 
print(a > b) 
  
# a < b is True 
print(a < b) 
  
# a == b is False 
print(a == b) 
  
# a != b is True 
print(a != b) 
  
# a >= b is False 
print(a >= b) 
  
# a <= b is True 
print(a <= b) 

Output:

False
True
False
True
False
True

3) Logical operators: Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical NOT operations.


OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
and	Logical AND: True if both the operands are true	x and y
or	Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true	x or y
not	Logical NOT: True if operand is false	not x

# Examples of Logical Operator 
a = True
b = False
  
# Print a and b is False 
print(a and b) 
  
# Print a or b is True 
print(a or b) 
  
# Print not a is False 
print(not a) 
Output:

False
True
False




 

4) Bitwise operators: Bitwise operators acts on bits and performs bit by bit operation.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
&	Bitwise AND	x & y
|	Bitwise OR	x | y
~	Bitwise NOT	~x
^	Bitwise XOR	x ^ y
>>	Bitwise right shift	x>>
<<	Bitwise left shift	x<<
# Examples of Bitwise operators 
a = 10
b = 4
  
# Print bitwise AND operation   
print(a & b) 
  
# Print bitwise OR operation 
print(a | b) 
  
# Print bitwise NOT operation  
print(~a) 
  
# print bitwise XOR operation  
print(a ^ b) 
  
# print bitwise right shift operation

40

5) Assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables.


OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX

Special operators: There are some special type of operators like-

6) Identity operators-
is and is not are the identity operators both are used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.
is          True if the operands are identical 
is not      True if the operands are not identical 

# Examples of Identity operators 
a1 = 3
b1 = 3
a2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
b2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
a3 = [1,2,3] 
b3 = [1,2,3] 
  
  
print(a1 is not b1) 
  
  
print(a2 is b2) 
  
# Output is False, since lists are mutable. 
print(a3 is b3) 
Output:

False
True
False

7) Membership operators-
in and not in are the membership operators; used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence.
in            True if value is found in the sequence
not in        True if value is not found in the sequence


# Examples of Membership operator 
x = 'Geeks for Geeks'
y = {3:'a',4:'b'} 
  
  
print('G' in x) 
  
print('geeks' not in x) 
  
print('Geeks' not in x) 
  
print(3 in y) 
  
print('b' in y) 
Output:

True
True
False
True
False

===========================================
Monkey Patching in Python (Dynamic Behavior)

In Python, the term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. In Python, we can actually change the behavior of code at run-time.


# monk.py 
class A: 
     def func(self): 
          print "func() is being called"
We use above module (monk) in below code and change behavior of func() at run-time by assigning different value.


import monk 
def monkey_f(self): 
     print "monkey_f() is being called"
   
# replacing address of "func" with "monkey_f" 
monk.A.func = monkey_f 
obj = monk.A() 
  
# calling function "func" whose address got replaced 
# with function "monkey_f()" 
obj.func() 
Examples:

Output :monkey_f() is being called

==================================
Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. Especially it plays vital role in the context of multiple inheritance as single method may be found in multiple super classes.

class A:
    def process(self):
        print('A process()')


class B:
    def process(self):
        print('B process()')

class C(A, B):
    pass

obj = C()
obj.process()
When you run the above code, it prints the following:
A process()


class A:
    def process(self):
        print('A process()')


class B:
    def process(self):
        print('B process()')


class C(A, B):
    def process(self):
        print('C process()')


class D(C,B):
    pass


obj = D()
obj.process()

print(D.mro())

Running the above program will produce the following output:
C process()

class A:
    def process(self):
        print('A process()')


class B(A):
    pass


class C(A):
    def process(self):
        print('C process()')


class D(B,C):
    pass


obj = D()
obj.process()
Output of the above program is:
C process()

class A:
    def process(self):
        print('A process()')


class B(A):
    def process(self):
        print('B process()')


class C(A, B):
    pass


obj = C()
obj.process()
When you run the above code, the following error is shown:
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases A, B
The problem comes from the fact that class A is a super class for both C and B. If you construct MRO then it should be like this:
C -> A -> B -> A
Then according to the rule (good head) A should NOT be ahead of B as A is super class of B. So new MRO must be like this:
==============================

Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a type of process lock which is used by python whenever it deals with processes. Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. This means that in python only one thread will be executed at a time. The performance of the single-threaded process and the multi-threaded process will be the same in python and this is because of GIL in python. We can not achieve multithreading in python because we have global interpreter lock which restricts the threads and works as a single thread.

Python has something that no other language has that is a reference counter. With the help of the reference counter, we can count the total number of references that are made internally in python to assign a value to a data object. Due to this counter, we can count the references and when this count reaches to zero the variable or data object will be released automatically.

>>> import sys
>>> a = []
>>> b = a
>>> sys.getrefcount(a)
3

This reference counter variable needed to be protected, because sometimes two threads increase or decrease its value simultaneously by doing that it may lead to memory leaked so in order to protect thread we add locks to all data structures that are shared across threads but sometimes by adding locks there exists a multiple locks which lead to another problem that is deadlock. In order to avoid memory leaked and deadlocks problem, we used single lock on the interpreter that is Global Interpreter Lock(GIL).
