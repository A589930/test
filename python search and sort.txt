===================
paramiko is used for performing ssh over another server, executing commands over there and getting the output/ error of that commands


import paramiko

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect(hostname, username = 'vijay', password='Vijay123')
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('df -hk')
print(stdout.readlines())

there are 2 paramiko policies
1) reject policy ( default policy)
2) autoadd policy

by default all the ssh.connect(hostname, username = 'vijay', password='Vijay123') will fail saying that known_hosts file doesn't contain the entry of hostname.
so we need to add the AutoAddPolicy to paramiko after that this error will not appear

Explain functionality of python interpreter

1. Looks at the date/time of your script and checks if there is a .pyc file for your script with a later date than your script; if there is skip stage 
2. Read the script line by line and converts that script into python byte code, and then writes the byte code into a pyc file. If your application has mutiple files it creates a pyc file for every .py file. It is at this stage that syntax errors are generated.
3. Load the first pyc file into memory, and the interpret then executes the file instruction by instruction, it is at this stage Runtime errors are created if your code generates such errors. If neccessary then other pyc files are loaded into memory and executed.

============================
what is Pickling 

It is used to serilize and deserialize the python objects
Pickling: It is a process where a Python object is converted into a byte stream.
Unpickling: It is the reverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an python object.
Module Interface :

dumps() â€“ This function is called to serialize an object.
loads() â€“ This function is called to de-serialize a data stream.

====================================================
what are differet type of operators in Pyton:

1) Arithmetic operators: Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
+	Addition: adds two operands	x + y
-	Subtraction: subtracts two operands	x - y
*	Multiplication: multiplies two operands	x * y
/	Division (float): divides the first operand by the second	x / y
//	Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second	x // y
%	Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second	x % y

# Examples of Arithmetic Operator 
a = 9
b = 4
  
# Addition of numbers 
add = a + b 
# Subtraction of numbers  
sub = a - b 
# Multiplication of number  
mul = a * b 
# Division(float) of number  
div1 = a / b 
# Division(floor) of number  
div2 = a // b 
# Modulo of both number 
mod = a % b 
  
# print results 
print(add) 
print(sub) 
print(mul) 
print(div1) 
print(div2) 
print(mod) 
Output:

13
5
36
2.25
2
1


2) Relational Operators: Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
>	Greater than: True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
<	Less than: True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
==	Equal to: True if both operands are equal	x == y
!=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
>=	Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y

# Examples of Relational Operators 
a = 13
b = 33
  
# a > b is False 
print(a > b) 
  
# a < b is True 
print(a < b) 
  
# a == b is False 
print(a == b) 
  
# a != b is True 
print(a != b) 
  
# a >= b is False 
print(a >= b) 
  
# a <= b is True 
print(a <= b) 

Output:

False
True
False
True
False
True

3) Logical operators: Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical NOT operations.


OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
and	Logical AND: True if both the operands are true	x and y
or	Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true	x or y
not	Logical NOT: True if operand is false	not x

# Examples of Logical Operator 
a = True
b = False
  
# Print a and b is False 
print(a and b) 
  
# Print a or b is True 
print(a or b) 
  
# Print not a is False 
print(not a) 
Output:

False
True
False




 

4) Bitwise operators: Bitwise operators acts on bits and performs bit by bit operation.
OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
&	Bitwise AND	x & y
|	Bitwise OR	x | y
~	Bitwise NOT	~x
^	Bitwise XOR	x ^ y
>>	Bitwise right shift	x>>
<<	Bitwise left shift	x<<
# Examples of Bitwise operators 
a = 10
b = 4
  
# Print bitwise AND operation   
print(a & b) 
  
# Print bitwise OR operation 
print(a | b) 
  
# Print bitwise NOT operation  
print(~a) 
  
# print bitwise XOR operation  
print(a ^ b) 
  
# print bitwise right shift operation  
print(a >> 2) 
  
# print bitwise left shift operation  
print(a << 2) 
Output:

0
14
-11
14
2
40

5) Assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables.


OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	SYNTAX
=	Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand	x = y + z
+=	Add AND: Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand	a+=b     a=a+b
-=	Subtract AND: Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand	a-=b       a=a-b
*=	Multiply AND: Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand	a*=b       a=a*b
/=	Divide AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand	a/=b         a=a/b
%=	Modulus AND: Takes modulus using left and right operands and assign result to left operand	a%=b   a=a%b
//=	Divide(floor) AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign the value(floor) to left operand	a//=b       a=a//b
**=	Exponent AND: Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand	a**=b     a=a**b
&=	Performs Bitwise AND on operands and assign value to left operand	a&=b     a=a&b
|=	Performs Bitwise OR on operands and assign value to left operand	a|=b         a=a|b
^=	Performs Bitwise xOR on operands and assign value to left operand	a^=b       a=a^b
>>=	Performs Bitwise right shift on operands and assign value to left operand	a>>=b     a=a>>b
<<=	Performs Bitwise left shift on operands and assign value to left operand	a <<= b                    a= a << b


Special operators: There are some special type of operators like-

6) Identity operators-
is and is not are the identity operators both are used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.
is          True if the operands are identical 
is not      True if the operands are not identical 

# Examples of Identity operators 
a1 = 3
b1 = 3
a2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
b2 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
a3 = [1,2,3] 
b3 = [1,2,3] 
  
  
print(a1 is not b1) 
  
  
print(a2 is b2) 
  
# Output is False, since lists are mutable. 
print(a3 is b3) 
Output:

False
True
False

7) Membership operators-
in and not in are the membership operators; used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence.
in            True if value is found in the sequence
not in        True if value is not found in the sequence


# Examples of Membership operator 
x = 'Geeks for Geeks'
y = {3:'a',4:'b'} 
  
  
print('G' in x) 
  
print('geeks' not in x) 
  
print('Geeks' not in x) 
  
print(3 in y) 
  
print('b' in y) 
Output:

True
True
False
True
False

===========================================
what is Monkey Patching in Python (Dynamic Behavior)

In Python, the term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. In Python, we can actually change the behavior of code at run-time.


# monk.py 
class A: 
     def func(self): 
          print "func() is being called"
We use above module (monk) in below code and change behavior of func() at run-time by assigning different value.


import monk 
def monkey_f(self): 
     print "monkey_f() is being called"
   
# replacing address of "func" with "monkey_f" 
monk.A.func = monkey_f 
obj = monk.A() 
  
# calling function "func" whose address got replaced 
# with function "monkey_f()" 
obj.func() 
Examples:

Output :monkey_f() is being called

what are different list methods

s=[1,2,3,4]
1) append():
it is used to append at th end of list

2) insert(position , element)
s.insert(1 , 1.5)
>>> s
[1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4]

3) list1.extend(list2)
Adds contents to List2 to the end of List1.


List1 = [1, 2, 3] 
List2 = [2, 3, 4] 
  
# Add List2 to List1 
List1.extend(List2)

o/p : [1,2,3,2,3,4]


4) sum(List)
Calculates sum of all the elements of List.

5) count():Calculates total occurrence of given element of List.
List = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1] 
print(List.count(1))

o/p : 5

6) len(list_name) : Calculates total length of Lis

7) List.index(element[,start[,end]])

List = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1] 
  
# will check from index 2 to 5. 
print(List.index(2,2,6))

8) min() : Calculates minimum of all the elements of List.

9) max(): Calculates maximum of all the elements of List.

10) list.sort() : it will sort in ascending order
list.sort(reverse=True) : it will sort in desceding order

11) pop(index) : index is not necessary parameter , if index not specified then removed last element from list else removes index elemet from list

List = [2.3, 4.445, 3, 5.33, 1.054, 2.5] 
print(List.pop()) 
print(List.pop(0))

o/p : 2.5
2.3

12) del :  used to delete element
del List[0] : deleted first element

del List : deletes entire list

what is differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x ?
 1) Division Operator
 print 7 / 5
   
Output in Python 2.x // When two integers are divided, you always provide integer value.
1 

Output in Python 3.x : //Whenever two integers are divided, you get a float value
1.4 

2) print() function
print 'Hello, Geeks'  // python 2 supports this , 3 doesn't supports
print('Hope You like these facts')  // python 3 supports this


3) xrange() of Python 2.x doesnâ€™t exist in Python 3.x

4) "as" keyword is needed in exception handling

try: 
    trying_to_check_error 
except NameError, err: 
    print err, 'Error Caused'   # Would not work in Python 3.x , it works in python 2
	
	
try: 
     trying_to_check_error

what is Decorator :
it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.

def hello_decorator(func): 

    def inner1(): 
        print("Hello, this is before function execution") 
        func()   
        print("This is after function execution") 
          
    return inner1 
  
  
# defining a function, to be called inside wrapper 
def function_to_be_used(): 
    print("This is inside the function !!") 
  
function_to_be_used = hello_decorator(function_to_be_used) 
  
function_to_be_used() 
Output:

Hello, this is before function execution
This is inside the function !!
This is after function execution
======================
does python supports Method overloading?

python does not supports method overloading. We may overload the methods but can only use the latest defined method.

def product(a, b): 
    p = a * b 
    print(p) 
      
# Second product method 
# Takes three argument and print their 
# product 
def product(a, b, c): 
    p = a * b*c 
    print(p) 
  
# Uncommenting the below line shows an error     
# product(4, 5) 
  
# This line will call the second product method 
product(4, 5, 5)

Output:
100


# Function to take multiple arguments 
def add(datatype, *args): 
  
    # if datatype is int 
    # initialize answer as 0 
    if datatype =='int': 
        answer = 0
          
    # if datatype is str 
    # initialize answer as '' 
    if datatype =='str': 
        answer ='' 
  
    # Traverse through the arguments 
    for x in args: 
  
        # This will do addition if the  
        # arguments are int. Or concatenation  
        # if the arguments are str 
        answer = answer + x 
  
    print(answer) 
  
# Integer 
add('int', 5, 6) 
  
# String 
add('str', 'Hi ', 'Geeks') 

Output:

>>> Student.info()
this is Student class in student module


instance method deals with instance variables , class method deals with class variables , those variables which are declared outside of a method are said to be class method.
if there is any method which doesn't want to use instance and class variables then that method is static method

=========================================
what is context manager in Python ?

context manager:
 In any programming language, the usage of resources like file operations or database connections is very common. But these resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if user have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources.In Python, it can be achieved by the usage of context managers which facilitate the proper handling of resources

When creating context managers using classes, user need to ensure that the class has the methods: __enter__() and __exit__(). The __enter__() returns the resource that needs to be managed and the __exit__() does not return anything but performs the cleanup operations.

class FileManager(): 
    def __init__(self, filename, mode): 
        self.filename = filename 
        self.mode = mode 
        self.file = None
          
    def __enter__(self): 
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode) 
        return self.file
      
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback): 
        self.file.close() 
  
# loading a file  
with FileManager('test.txt', 'w') as f: 
    f.write('Test') 
  
print(f.closed) 
Output:

True
 
File management using context manager and with statement :

On executing the with block, the following operations happen in sequence:

A FileManager object is created with test.txt as the filename and w(write) as the mode when __init__ method is executed.
The __enter__ method opens the test.txt file in write mode(setup operation) and returns the FileManager object to variable f.
The text â€˜Testâ€™ is written into the file.
The __exit__ method takes care of closing the file on exiting the with block(teardown operation).
When print(f.closed) is run, the output is True as the FileManager has already taken care of closing the file which otherwise needed to be explicitly done.

======================

what is difference between __del__ and __delete__ method ?
__del__ is a destructor method which is called as soon as all references of the object are deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected.


class Example: 
	
	# Initializing 
	def __init__(self): 
		print("Example Instance.") 

	# Calling destructor 
	def __del__(self): 
		print("Destructor called, Example deleted.") 
	
obj = Example() 
del obj 

O/: 
Example Instance.
Destructor called, Example deleted.

__delete__:
__delete__ is used to delete the attribute of an instance i.e removing the value of attribute present in the owner class for an instance.


class Example(object): 
  
    # Initializing 
    def __init__(self): 
        print("Example Instance.") 
  
    # Calling __delete__ 
    def __delete__(self, instance): 
        print ("Deleted in Example object.") 
  
  
# Creating object of Example 
# class as an descriptor attribute 
# of this class 
class Foo(object): 
    exp = Example() 
  
# Driver's code 
f = Foo() 
del f.exp 


Output:
Example Instance.
Deleted in Example object.

difference : 
__delete__ 												__del__
it is used to delete attribute of a class 				It is used as destructor
need to called explicitly  								gets called implicitly
executed before program ends							executed after program ends


combination of __del__ and __delete__
# Python program to demonstrate 
# __del__ and __delete__ 


class Example(object): 

	# Initializing 
	def __init__(self): 
		self.value = '' 

	# deletes an attribute 
	def __delete__(self, instance): 
		print ("Inside __delete__") 
		
	# Destructor 
	def __del__(self): 
		print("Inside __del__") 
	
	
class Foo(object): 
	exp = Example() 

# Driver's code 
f = Foo() 
del f.exp 

Output:

Inside __delete__
Inside __del__

1) update

# Python program to show working 
# of update() method in Dictionary 

# Dictionary with three items 
Dictionary1 = { 'A': 'Geeks', 'B': 'For', } 
Dictionary2 = { 'B': 'Geeks' } 

# Dictionary before Updation 
print("Original Dictionary:") 
print(Dictionary1) 

# update the value of key 'B' 
Dictionary1.update(Dictionary2) 
print("Dictionary after updation:") 
print(Dictionary1) 

o/p:
Original Dictionary:
{'A': 'Geeks', 'B': 'For'}

Dictionary after updation:
{'A': 'Geeks', 'B': 'Geeks'}

# Python program to show working 
# of update() method in Dictionary 

# Dictionary with single item 
Dictionary1 = { 'A': 'Geeks'} 

# Dictionary before Updation 
print("Original Dictionary:") 
print(Dictionary1) 

# update the Dictionary with iterable 
Dictionary1.update(B = 'For', C = 'Geeks') 
print("Dictionary after updation:") 
print(Dictionary1) 

Output:

Original Dictionary:
{'A': 'Geeks'}

Dictionary after updation:
{'C': 'Geeks', 'B': 'For', 'A': 'Geeks'}


2) setdefault(): method returns the value of a key (if the key is in dictionary). If not, it inserts key with a value to the dictionary.

Returns:
Value of the key if it is in the dictionary.
None if key is not in the dictionary and default_value is not specified.
default_value if key is not in the dictionary and default_value is specified.


3) fromkeys :
setdefault() method returns the value of a key (if the key is in dictionary). If not, it inserts key with a value to the dictionary.

l=[1,2]
d=dict.fromkeys(l)
>>> d
{1: None, 2: None}
>>> dd=dict.fromkeys(l,0)
>>> dd
{1: 0, 2: 0}

Local, Global and non Local variable

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-local-variables-python/

a = 1
  
# Uses global because there is no local 'a' 
def f(): 
    print 'Inside f() : ', a 
  
# Variable 'a' is redefined as a local 
def g():     
    a = 2
    print 'Inside g() : ',a 
  
# Uses global keyword to modify global 'a' 
def h():     
    global a 
    a = 3
    print 'Inside h() : ',a 
  
# Global scope 
print 'global : ',a 
f() 
print 'global : ',a 
g() 
print 'global : ',a 
h() 
print 'global : ',a 
Output:

global :  1
Inside f() :  1
global :  1
Inside g() :  2
global :  1
Inside h() :  3
global :  3

NonLocal variable
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-of-nonlocal-vs-use-of-global-keyword-in-python/

def fun(): 
    var1 = 10
  
    def gun(): 
        # tell python explicitly that it  
        # has to access var1 initialized  
        # in fun on line 2 
        # using the keyword nonlocal 
        nonlocal var1 
        var1 = var1 + 10
        print(var1) 
  
    gun() 
fun() 
Output:
20
In this example, before initializing var1 in gun(). We have explicitly told Python that, do not initialize a new variable, instead access var1 present already on line 2. using the keyword nonlocal So when interpreter performs addition, it access the value 10(already present) and error is avoided.
