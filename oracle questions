1) what is dual table 

it si a special one ro table which is create by default whenever u install oracel database
it is used for selecting a psudeo column such as sysdate or user ( select user from dual) (select sysdate from dual)
it can be used to perform calculations ( select 2*45 from dual)
it can be used as sequence generator 

2) how many columns and rows are in dual table

1 row and 1 column ( name of column dummy and value is X)

3)can we insert more rows in dual table
yes


4) can we create table based on existing table
yes using CTAS ( create table as )

create table sales1 as select * from sales

5) can we drop all columns from table
no

6)what are psudeo columns
similiar to table columns but are not actually stored in table
we can select psudeo columns but cant update delete insert into them
eg SYSDATE , ROWID , ROWNUM

7) what is difference between count(1) and count(*) ?
exactly same
they take same amount of resources
they incur same amount of work


6) what is difference between IN and = operator
= accepts only 1 value
IN operator can accept more than 1 value

select eid, salary 
from emp
where d_id=10

select e_id , salary
from emp
where d_id IN (100 , 110 , 120)

7) how many max values can in operator take ?
999

8)difference betn exist and in when using subqueries ?

IN 
The inner query is executed first and list of values obtained as result are used by outer query. the inner query is executed only once

select e_id , salary
from emp
where d_id in( select d_id
				from department)
				
				
EXISTS
the first row from outer query is executed and then the inner query is executed , the outer query output is uses this this result for checking

the process of inner query execution repeates as many no of times as there are outer query rows


select *
from customer cs
where exists ( select * 
				from order_details ord
				where ord.id=cs.id )
				
				
9)what is differece having and where caluse

where is used to filter out data before aggragation takes place
having is used to filter out data after the aggregation takes place

select d_id , sum(salary) as salary
from emp
where d_id in ( 100 , 200)
group by d_id
having sum(salary) > 10000

in this first the where condition is applied on the data then it performs grouping by d_id
and then sum(salary) > 10000 is applied

10)diff betwenn delete and truncate ,which is fast ?
delete :
it is used to selectively remove rows form table using where clause
if no  where clause then all rows are removed

after performing delete operation u need to commit or rollback the transcation to make change permenant or undo it

in delete , triggers on the table are fired if there are any triggers


Truncate :
it removes all the rows from table , you can not rollback the data
it does not affect any of the table indexes , trigges or dependencies 
since no undo log is maintained and has no dependencies truncate is faster


11) can we use where condition with truncate ?
no

12)
can we delete a record from moret han 1 table simultaneously ?
yes

delete t1 , t2
from t1 inner join t2
where t1.id = t2.id
and t2.id=t3.id

13)how to remove duplicate rows from table

d_id d_name branch
1     IT    IT_1
1     IT    IT_1
2     test   test_1
3     CS     CS-1
3     CS     CS-1

delete from department d1
where d1.rowid > 
( select min(d2.rowid) from department d2
where d1.d_id = d2.d_id
and d1.d_name= d2.d_name
and d1.branch = d2.branch )


14 ) what is self join , explain with example

it is a join in which table is joined with itself
ex > getting details about emp and its manager
select e1.ename as employee_name, 
e2.ename as manager_name
from emp
where e1.mgr =  e2.empno

15) what happends when join condition is missed

it performs a cartessian join which is also called as cross join
each row in first table is paired with all row in second table

selecct * 
from sales , customer

16)which is faster among left outerjoin and right outer join
there is no difference between same


17)explain various data types in oracle

character datatypes 
-char
-varchar
-varchar2
-nchar and nvarchar2
-long

numeric data dtypes
-number
-binary float
-binary double

date datatypes
-date
-timestamp
-timstamp with timezone
-timestamp with local time zone

large objects
-clob
nclob
bfile

xml data types
-xmltype

18)diifference between char , varchar and varchar2

varchar is reservedd by oracle fr future releaes and is advised not to use
char variable stores data in fixed length 
varchar2 stores data ( variable length text)

19) diff betn data and timstamp data types
data can store month ,day , year , century , hours , minute , seconds

timestamp can store even miliseconds

timestamp can optionall store timezone as well

20) difference betn char and nchar
when data is stored in char , it takes n bytes for n chars 
while nchar takes 2n bytes for n chars since data is stored in nchar is unicode format

21)
explain composite data types
composite data type can be record  , table , nested table or varray

TYPE student_data IS RECORD
(
first_name varchar2(20),
id number(2),
);

22)
what does instr() and substr() return ?
substr() is used to extract substring from string

instr() is used to return location of substring from string

23) what are conversion function
it is used to typecast data from one datatype to another data type

select to_date('January 15 2015', 'month dd, yyyy') from dual

here we are converting char to date format

24) what is usage o lpad and rpad function

it is used to add padding characters to the left or right side of a string up to a given length
the default padding character is space
if string's length is greater than required length then it will be trimmed

25) what is difference between single row and multi row functions

single row functions return single row for every row of quered table / view

select eno,ename, to_char(sal , '9,999.99') from emp

multi row functions return single result row based on groups of rows 

select dno, sum(sal) from emp group by dno


26) how to add 1 month to system date

select ADD_MONTHS( SYSDATE , 1) from dual


substract 1 month
select ADD_MONTHS( SYSDATE , -1) from dual

27) how to add 1 hour to SYSDATE

select SYSDATE + (1/24) from dual

28) what is output of below sql statements

select 1+ null from dual
select 1* null from dual
select 1/ null from dual

ANS : null

any arithmetic operation on null is null

29) difference between nvl , nvl2 and null if functions

1) nvl() : takes 2 parameter
if the first parameter value is not null then it returns first parameter value
if the first parameter value is null then it return the value in second parameter

select nvl(null, 1) from dual // 1
select  nvl('a' , 1) from dual // a


2) nvl2(): It accepts 3 parameter
if first parameter value is not null then it return second parameter
if first parameter value is null then it returns third parameter
select nvl2( 'a' , 1,2) from dual //1
select nvl2( null , 1,2)  from dual // 2

3) nullif : accepts 2 parameter
returns null if both parameters are equal
if both aprameters are not equal then it returns first parameter
select nullif('a' ,'b') from dual // a
select nullif('a' , 'a') from dual // null


30) what is COALESCE function ?

it accepts 2 or more functions

return first non-null value in list
if alll parameters are null values it returns null

select COALESSCE( null , null, 'a' ,'b') from dual  // a

31) what is output of below query ?
select * from test1 where c_phone = null ;
select * from test1 where c_phone in (null);
ans : 0 row's are returned

because we cant use "=" or "in:" operator with null , we should use "is" oeprator with null

32) what is output of below query ?

select 'tom' ||null || 'joe' from dual 

ans : tomjoe

33)which data type does not allow 'null' values ?
ans : none . all data type can be null . only if you have specified NOT NULL constraint for any column then only its value cant be null

34) what are constraints / integrity constraints ? their types ?

it is a way of enforcing rule into database , it maintains integrity of database
Integrity constraints are used to prevent entry of invalid info into tables

types :
1) not null :
it prohibits a database value from being null

2) unique :
it prohibits multiple rows fom having same value in same column  but it allows null value

3) primary key :
it is same as unique key but it cant be null

4) foreign key :
it requires value in one table to match value in another table

5) check :
it requires a value in database to comply with specified condition 
for ex we can set salary column to be not greater than 100000

35) can a table have 2 primary key ? 
NO

36) how to disable constraint ?
alter table tablename
disable constraint constraint_name

37) if you create a primary key  by default which index is created ?
by default unique index is create 

38) what are various set oeprations ?

1) UNION : it return rows of first query + rows of second query minux duplicate rows
2) UNION ALL : it returns rows from both queris including duplicate rows
3) minus : rows that are unique for first query will be retrieved
4) intersect : common rows from both query will be retrieved


39) difference betwen joins and set operations ?

set :it is used to combine similiar type of data from 2 or more table
joins : it is used to select columns from 2 or mote tables based on logical relationship between tables;


40) what is difference between union and union all operator ?
union set operator return all distinct rows from selected queries means duplicate rows are removed
union all set operator removed duplicate rows from queries

41) which is faster betwen union and union all ?

union all is faster bcoz removal of duplicates requires extra processing hence takes some time

42) should no of columns be same when performing set operations ?

yes
select eno , ename from emo:
union all
select eno , ename from emp_history ;

43) should data type of columns be same when performing when set operations ?

yes

44) what is inline view ?

a subquery which appears in the FROM Clause is called as inline view
ex :

select * 
from sales s
( select customer_id
from customer 
where region = 'south'
) c
where c.customer_id = s.customer_id


45) what is scalar subquery ?
a subquery which appears in select clause is called as sclaar subquery 
it can return only 1 row and 1 column

select s.customer_id,
s.total_amount,
(select first_name
from customer c
where c.customer_id = s.customer_id
) first_name
from sales s


46)what is index , what are various indexes and what is default index ?
indexes are data structres used by oracle/mysql to faciliate faster data retrivial 

type 
B-Tree index
bitmap index
bitmap join index
function based index

we can create unique or non unique index
