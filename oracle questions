1) what is dual table 

it si a special one ro table which is create by default whenever u install oracel database
it is used for selecting a psudeo column such as sysdate or user ( select user from dual) (select sysdate from dual)
it can be used to perform calculations ( select 2*45 from dual)
it can be used as sequence generator 

2) how many columns and rows are in dual table

1 row and 1 column ( name of column dummy and value is X)

3)can we insert more rows in dual table
yes


4) can we create table based on existing table
yes using CTAS ( create table as )

create table sales1 as select * from sales

5) can we drop all columns from table
no

6)what are psudeo columns
similiar to table columns but are not actually stored in table
we can select psudeo columns but cant update delete insert into them
eg SYSDATE , ROWID , ROWNUM

7) what is difference between count(1) and count(*) ?
exactly same
they take same amount of resources
they incur same amount of work


6) what is difference between IN and = operator
= accepts only 1 value
IN operator can accept more than 1 value

select eid, salary 
from emp
where d_id=10

select e_id , salary
from emp
where d_id IN (100 , 110 , 120)

7) how many max values can in operator take ?
999

8)difference betn exist and in when using subqueries ?

IN 
The inner query is executed first and list of values obtained as result are used by outer query. the inner query is executed only once

select e_id , salary
from emp
where d_id in( select d_id
				from department)
				
				
EXISTS
the first row from outer query is executed and then the inner query is executed , the outer query output is uses this this result for checking

the process of inner query execution repeates as many no of times as there are outer query rows


select *
from customer cs
where exists ( select * 
				from order_details ord
				where ord.id=cs.id )
				
				
9)what is differece having and where caluse

where is used to filter out data before aggragation takes place
having is used to filter out data after the aggregation takes place

select d_id , sum(salary) as salary
from emp
where d_id in ( 100 , 200)
group by d_id
having sum(salary) > 10000

in this first the where condition is applied on the data then it performs grouping by d_id
and then sum(salary) > 10000 is applied

10)diff betwenn delete and truncate ,which is fast ?
delete :
it is used to selectively remove rows form table using where clause
if no  where clause then all rows are removed

after performing delete operation u need to commit or rollback the transcation to make change permenant or undo it

in delete , triggers on the table are fired if there are any triggers


Truncate :
it removes all the rows from table , you can not rollback the data
it does not affect any of the table indexes , trigges or dependencies 
since no undo log is maintained and has no dependencies truncate is faster


11) can we use where condition with truncate ?
no

12)
can we delete a record from moret han 1 table simultaneously ?
yes

delete t1 , t2
from t1 inner join t2
where t1.id = t2.id
and t2.id=t3.id

13)how to remove duplicate rows from table

d_id d_name branch
1     IT    IT_1
1     IT    IT_1
2     test   test_1
3     CS     CS-1
3     CS     CS-1

delete from department d1
where d1.rowid > 
( select min(d2.rowid) from department d2
where d1.d_id = d2.d_id
and d1.d_name= d2.d_name
and d1.branch = d2.branch )


14 ) what is self join , explain with example

it is a join in which table is joined with itself
ex > getting details about emp and its manager
select e1.ename as employee_name, 
e2.ename as manager_name
from emp
where e1.mgr =  e2.empno

15) what happends when join condition is missed

it performs a cartessian join which is also called as cross join
each row in first table is paired with all row in second table

selecct * 
from sales , customer

16)which is faster among left outerjoin and right outer join
there is no difference between same


17)explain various data types in oracle

character datatypes 
-char
-varchar
-varchar2
-nchar and nvarchar2
-long

numeric data dtypes
-number
-binary float
-binary double

date datatypes
-date
-timestamp
-timstamp with timezone
-timestamp with local time zone

large objects
-clob
nclob
bfile

xml data types
-xmltype

18)diifference between char , varchar and varchar2

varchar is reservedd by oracle fr future releaes and is advised not to use
char variable stores data in fixed length 
varchar2 stores data ( variable length text)

19) diff betn data and timstamp data types
data can store month ,day , year , century , hours , minute , seconds

timestamp can store even miliseconds

timestamp can optionall store timezone as well

20) difference betn char and nchar
when data is stored in char , it takes n bytes for n chars 
while nchar takes 2n bytes for n chars since data is stored in nchar is unicode format

21)
explain composite data types
composite data type can be record  , table , nested table or varray

TYPE student_data IS RECORD
(
first_name varchar2(20),
id number(2),
);
