Git uses ‘C’ language
git init
//initlizes a empty git repository in folder 
git status
// how many files are still not staged and how many are new files , also shows currently we are on which branch
git add .
// it will stage all files present in current folder 
git commit -m 'This is initial commit'
// this is used for commiting all the files present in the folder
git branch  NewBranch
// for creating new branch
git checkout  NewBranch // for switching to NewBranch
git checkout master // for going back to master branch
git merge NewBranch   // for merging content of NewBrnach into master Branch
git commit -a -m 'second commit'  // if doing this then there is no need to do first staging and then commiting , 
you can directly do commit. but in this way only updated files will be commited and newly created files will not be commited
git config --global user.email "bhalekarvijay5@mail.com" // for setting email id
git config --global user.name "vijay"  // for setting name
git push -u origin master  // for pushing content into repo
git revert head 
git push -u origin master // for reverting last commited and pushed change to repository
git log --oneline  // show history of all last commits and reverts
Git pull = git fetch + git merge
git pull https://github.com/A589930/test.git // pull
