GIT : IT is distributed version control system
GIt : opensource tool/ software used for version controlling
github: version control service
bitbucket & gitlab are same as github they provide service to GIT
github is not free while bitbucket is free
service of github is good as compare to bitcucket, github is purcased by Microsoft

after creating any folder on right click we get 2 option
1) GIT GUI
2) GIT BASH

git GUI uses GIT BASh in background

1) for getting the version of git
git --version
git version 2.18.0.windows.1


create any new folder --> go inside that folder --> right click git bash --> git init --> the newly create folder will behave like 
a new repository

git init
//initlizes a empty git repository in folder 

git bash works like linux commands.
Git supports 3 layer architecture
1) working area
2) staging area
3) commit area


for checkig the logged in user email and name
git config user.email
git config user.name


for adding to staging area:
git add .

if you want to remove from staging area then use command
gir reset filename

by mistakely you have added a change in file and not added that file to staging area then for removing that change from file use:
git checkout filename  // in this way we will go to our last commit state

for commiting the change:
git commit -m "messge for commit"

for pushing to git
git push -u origin  master

for pulling the data from github to local:
git pull origin master

Git add -A : stages ALL
git add . : stages new and modified , WITHOUT DELETED
git add -u : stages modified and deleted , WITHOUT NEW

For cloning any other repository into you local:
create a new folder , right click , git bash here 
git clone git@github.com:A589930/test.git  
a new folder will be created inside your folder


if you dont want to create new folder and just want script should be directly visible the
git clone git@github.com:A589930/test.git  .



for seeing the origin added:
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:A589930/test.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:A589930/test.git (push)

for removing the origin added
git remote rm origin
// here origin we have taken from output of above commands

git status
in git status command if you can see there is some delta between local file and git hub file then you can compare the change by following 
command:
git diff filename.txt

you have done change in one file and added that to stage and want to see the difference between staged and github file
git diff --staged filename.txt


.gitignore

if want any file not to push / pull / track then we can create a .gitignore file in you folder and add that files name in .gitignore file

git branch  NewBranch
// for creating new branch

git checkout  NewBranch // for switching to NewBranch
git checkout master // for going back to master branch
git merge NewBranch   // for merging content of NewBrnach into master Branch
