mtime : ls -l : show the last update to file content, it does not udpate with change in permission or owner
atime : ls -lu : shows the last file accessed time 
ctime : ls -lc : it changes when u change the files ownership or access permission .

file creation time : 
1) find files inode number by following command :
ls -i file.txt
2)find partition name on which your filesystem is residing by df -hk command
df -hk  (for example /dev/sda1)
3) debugfs -R 'stat <inode number>' /dev/sda1

1) what is difference between softlink and hardlink

A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file. But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. Even if you delete the original file, the hard link will still has the data of the original file. Because hard link acts as a mirror copy of the original file.

In a nutshell, a soft link

can cross the file system,
allows you to link between directories,
has different inode number and file permissions than original file,
permissions will not be updated,
has only the path of the original file, not the contents.
A hard Link

can’t cross the file system boundaries (i.e. A hardlink can only work on the same filesystem),
can’t link directories,
has the same inode number and permissions of original file,
permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.

IFS=":"
# Assign text data with ':' to $text
text="Red:Green:Blue"
for val in $text; do
    echo $val
done

How SSH works

To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within the user’s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.

When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication, it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which public key to use. The server then check its authorized_keys file for the public key, generate a random string and encrypts it using the public key. This encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated private key. The server will send this encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the associated private key.

Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the private key and combine the random string that is revealed with a previously negotiated session ID. It then generates an MD5 hash of this value and transmits it back to the server. The server already had the original message and the session ID, so it can compare an MD5 hash generated by those values and determine that the client must have the private key.

Generating an SSH Key Pair
Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a password. Unless there is a good reason not to, you should always authenticate using SSH keys.

A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. RSA keys are generally preferred and are the default key type.

To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your RSA private key. Press ENTER to leave this as the default, which will store them in the .ssh hidden directory in your user’s home directory. Leaving the default location selected will allow your SSH client to find the keys automatically.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
The next prompt allows you to enter a passphrase of an arbitrary length to secure your private key. By default, you will have to enter any passphrase you set here every time you use the private key, as an additional security measure. Feel free to press ENTER to leave this blank if you do not want a passphrase. Keep in mind though that this will allow anyone who gains control of your private key to login to your servers.

If you choose to enter a passphrase, nothing will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.

Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:e9:7c:fa:bf:c4:e5:9c:c9:b8:60:1f:fe:1c:d3:8a root@here
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |

|      o + = O .  |
|       + = = +   |
|      ....Eo+    |
+-----------------+
This procedure has generated an RSA SSH key pair, located in the .ssh hidden directory within your user’s home directory. These files are:

~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.

Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server with SSH-Copy-ID
To copy your public key to a server, allowing you to authenticate without a password, a number of approaches can be taken.

If you currently have password-based SSH access configured to your server, and you have the ssh-copy-id utility installed, this is a simple process. The ssh-copy-id tool is included in many Linux distributions’ OpenSSH packages, so it very likely may be installed by default.

If you have this option, you can easily transfer your public key by typing:

ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
This will prompt you for the user account’s password on the remote system:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
demo@111.111.11.111's password:
After typing in the password, the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key will be appended to the end of the user account’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'demo@111.111.11.111'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
You can now log into that account without a password:

ssh username@remote_host
Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Without SSH-Copy-ID
If you do not have the ssh-copy-id utility available, but still have password-based SSH access to the remote server, you can copy the contents of your public key in a different way.

You can output the contents of the key and pipe it into the ssh command. On the remote side, you can ensure that the ~/.ssh directory exists, and then append the piped contents into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
You will be asked to supply the password for the remote account:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.

After entering the password, your key will be copied, allowing you to log in without a password:

ssh username@remote_IP_host
Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Manually
If you do not have password-based SSH access available, you will have to add your public key to the remote server manually.

On your local machine, you can find the contents of your public key file by typing:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa 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 demo@test
You can copy this value, and manually paste it into the appropriate location on the remote server. You will have to log into the remote server through other means (like the DigitalOcean web console).

On the remote server, create the ~/.ssh directory if it does not already exist:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
Afterwards, you can create or append the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file by typing:

echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
You should now be able to log into the remote server without a password.


Server-Side Configuration Options
This section contains some common server-side configuration options that can shape the way that your server responds and what types of connections are allowed.

Disabling Password Authentication
If you have SSH keys configured, tested, and working properly, it is probably a good idea to disable password authentication. This will prevent any user from signing in with SSH using a password.

To do this, connect to your remote server and open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Inside of the file, search for the PasswordAuthentication directive. If it is commented out, uncomment it. Set it to “no” to disable password logins:

PasswordAuthentication no
After you have made the change, save and close the file. To implement the changes, you should restart the SSH service.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
Now, all accounts on the system will be unable to login with SSH using passwords.

Changing the Port that the SSH Daemon Runs On
Some administrators suggest that you change the default port that SSH runs on. This can help decrease the number of authentication attempts your server is subjected to from automated bots.

To change the port that the SSH daemon listens on, you will have to log into your remote server. Open the sshd_config file on the remote system with root privileges, either by logging in with that user or by using sudo:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Once you are inside, you can change the port that SSH runs on by finding the Port 22 specification and modifying it to reflect the port you wish to use. For instance, to change the port to 4444, put this in your file:

#Port 22
Port 4444
Save and close the file when you are finished. To implement the changes, you must restart the SSH daemon.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
After the daemon restarts, you will need to authenticate by specifying the port number (demonstrated in an earlier section).

Limiting the Users Who can Connect Through SSH
To explicitly limit the user accounts who are able to login through SSH, you can take a few different approaches, each of which involve editing the SSH daemon config file.

On your remote server, open this file now with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
The first method of specifying the accounts that are allowed to login is using the AllowUsers directive. Search for the AllowUsers directive in the file. If one does not exist, create it anywhere. After the directive, list the user accounts that should be allowed to login through SSH:

AllowUsers user1 user2
Save and close the file. Restart the daemon to implement your changes.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart


Disabling Root Login
It is often advisable to completely disable root login through SSH after you have set up an SSH user account that has sudo privileges.

To do this, open the SSH daemon configuration file with root or sudo on your remote server.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Inside, search for a directive called PermitRootLogin. If it is commented, uncomment it. Change the value to “no”:

PermitRootLogin no
Save and close the file. To implement your changes, restart the SSH daemon.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart

Linux Check User Password Expiration Date and Time

chage -l vijay

Sample outputs:

Last password change					: Jan 10, 2012
Password expires					: never
Password inactive					: never
Account expires						: never
Minimum number of days between password change		: 0
Maximum number of days between password change		: 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires	: 7
====================

nohup
The nohup command executes another program specified as its argument and ignores all SIGHUP (hangup) signals. SIGHUP is a signal that is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed.

Usually, when you run a program over SSH, if your connection drops or you log out, the session is terminated, and all the processes executed from the terminal will stop. This is where the nohup command comes handy. It ignores all hangup signals, and the process will continue to run.

command output to the nohup.out file. This file is created in the current working directory . If the user running the command doesn’t have write permissions to the working directory, the file is created in the user’s home directory.

nohup mycommand &
The output includes the shell job ID (surrounded with brackets) and process ID:

[1] 25177

If for some reason you want to terminate the process, use the kill command followed by the process ID:

kill -9 25132

How to bring background process to foreground

type fg to bring the last process back to foreground.

See all processes running in background 
$ jobs

If you have more than one process running in the background, do this:

$ jobs
[1]   Stopped                 vim
[2]-  Stopped                 bash
[3]+  Stopped                 vim 23
fg %3 to bring the vim 23 process back to foreground.

To start it running in the background, use bg; e.g.: bg %3
