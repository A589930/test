mtime : ls -l : show the last update to file content, it does not udpate with change in permission or owner
atime : ls -lu : shows the last file accessed time 
ctime : ls -lc : it changes when u change the files ownership or access permission .

file creation time : 
1) find files inode number by following command :
ls -i file.txt
2)find partition name on which your filesystem is residing by df -hk command
df -hk  (for example /dev/sda1)
3) debugfs -R 'stat <inode number>' /dev/sda1

unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     188023   9461/httpd

 -n : If you do not need to know the host name and just the ip address is sufficient then suppress the hostname lookup with the n option.
 -t : To list out only tcp connections use the t options.
 -u : To list out only udp connections use the t options.
 -a :  to list out all the current connections.
 -p : When viewing the open/listening ports and connections, its often useful to know the process name/pid which has opened that port or connection. The process details are made available by the 'p' option.

1) what is difference between softlink and hardlink

A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file. But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. Even if you delete the original file, the hard link will still has the data of the original file. Because hard link acts as a mirror copy of the original file.

In a nutshell, a soft link

can cross the partitions,
allows you to link between directories,
has different inode number and file permissions than original file,
permissions will not be updated,
has only the path of the original file, not the contents.

A hard Link

can’t cross the file system boundaries (i.e. A hardlink can only work on the same filesystem),
can’t link directories,
has the same inode number and permissions of original file,
permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.

# Declare ':' as delimiter for splitting the text
IFS=":"
# Assign text data with ':' to $text
text="Red:Green:Blue"
for val in $text; do
    echo $val
done

How SSH works

To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within the user’s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.

When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication, it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which public key to use. The server then check its authorized_keys file for the public key, generate a random string and encrypts it using the public key. This encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated private key. The server will send this encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the associated private key.

Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the private key and combine the random string that is revealed with a previously negotiated session ID. It then generates an MD5 hash of this value and transmits it back to the server. The server already had the original message and the session ID, so it can compare an MD5 hash generated by those values and determine that the client must have the private key.

Generating an SSH Key Pair
Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a password. Unless there is a good reason not to, you should always authenticate using SSH keys.

A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. RSA keys are generally preferred and are the default key type.

To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your RSA private key. Press ENTER to leave this as the default, which will store them in the .ssh hidden directory in your user’s home directory. Leaving the default location selected will allow your SSH client to find the keys automatically.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
The next prompt allows you to enter a passphrase of an arbitrary length to secure your private key. By default, you will have to enter any passphrase you set here every time you use the private key, as an additional security measure. Feel free to press ENTER to leave this blank if you do not want a passphrase. Keep in mind though that this will allow anyone who gains control of your private key to login to your servers.

If you choose to enter a passphrase, nothing will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.

Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:e9:7c:fa:bf:c4:e5:9c:c9:b8:60:1f:fe:1c:d3:8a root@here
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |

|      o + = O .  |
|       + = = +   |
|      ....Eo+    |
+-----------------+
This procedure has generated an RSA SSH key pair, located in the .ssh hidden directory within your user’s home directory. These files are:

~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.

Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server with SSH-Copy-ID
To copy your public key to a server, allowing you to authenticate without a password, a number of approaches can be taken.

If you currently have password-based SSH access configured to your server, and you have the ssh-copy-id utility installed, this is a simple process. The ssh-copy-id tool is included in many Linux distributions’ OpenSSH packages, so it very likely may be installed by default.

If you have this option, you can easily transfer your public key by typing:

ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
This will prompt you for the user account’s password on the remote system:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.

After typing in the password, the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key will be appended to the end of the user account’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'demo@111.111.11.111'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
You can now log into that account without a password:

Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Without SSH-Copy-ID
If you do not have the ssh-copy-id utility available, but still have password-based SSH access to the remote server, you can copy the contents of your public key in a different way.

You can output the contents of the key and pipe it into the ssh command. On the remote side, you can ensure that the ~/.ssh directory exists, and then append the piped contents into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
You will be asked to supply the password for the remote account:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.

Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Manually
If you do not have password-based SSH access available, you will have to add your public key to the remote server manually.

On your local machine, you can find the contents of your public key file by typing:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa 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 demo@test
You can copy this value, and manually paste it into the appropriate location on the remote server. You will have to log into the remote server through other means (like the DigitalOcean web console).

On the remote server, create the ~/.ssh directory if it does not already exist:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
Afterwards, you can create or append the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file by typing:

echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
You should now be able to log into the remote server without a password.


Server-Side Configuration Options
This section contains some common server-side configuration options that can shape the way that your server responds and what types of connections are allowed.

Disabling Password Authentication
If you have SSH keys configured, tested, and working properly, it is probably a good idea to disable password authentication. This will prevent any user from signing in with SSH using a password.

To do this, connect to your remote server and open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Inside of the file, search for the PasswordAuthentication directive. If it is commented out, uncomment it. Set it to “no” to disable password logins:

PasswordAuthentication no
After you have made the change, save and close the file. To implement the changes, you should restart the SSH service.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
Now, all accounts on the system will be unable to login with SSH using passwords.

Changing the Port that the SSH Daemon Runs On
Some administrators suggest that you change the default port that SSH runs on. This can help decrease the number of authentication attempts your server is subjected to from automated bots.

To change the port that the SSH daemon listens on, you will have to log into your remote server. Open the sshd_config file on the remote system with root privileges, either by logging in with that user or by using sudo:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Once you are inside, you can change the port that SSH runs on by finding the Port 22 specification and modifying it to reflect the port you wish to use. For instance, to change the port to 4444, put this in your file:

#Port 22
Port 4444
Save and close the file when you are finished. To implement the changes, you must restart the SSH daemon.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
After the daemon restarts, you will need to authenticate by specifying the port number (demonstrated in an earlier section).

Limiting the Users Who can Connect Through SSH
To explicitly limit the user accounts who are able to login through SSH, you can take a few different approaches, each of which involve editing the SSH daemon config file.

On your remote server, open this file now with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
The first method of specifying the accounts that are allowed to login is using the AllowUsers directive. Search for the AllowUsers directive in the file. If one does not exist, create it anywhere. After the directive, list the user accounts that should be allowed to login through SSH:

AllowUsers user1 user2
Save and close the file. Restart the daemon to implement your changes.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart


Disabling Root Login
It is often advisable to completely disable root login through SSH after you have set up an SSH user account that has sudo privileges.

To do this, open the SSH daemon configuration file with root or sudo on your remote server.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Inside, search for a directive called PermitRootLogin. If it is commented, uncomment it. Change the value to “no”:

PermitRootLogin no
Save and close the file. To implement your changes, restart the SSH daemon.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart

nohup
The nohup command executes another program specified as its argument and ignores all SIGHUP (hangup) signals. SIGHUP is a signal that is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed.

Usually, when you run a program over SSH, if your connection drops or you log out, the session is terminated, and all the processes executed from the terminal will stop. This is where the nohup command comes handy. It ignores all hangup signals, and the process will continue to run.

command output to the nohup.out file. This file is created in the current working directory . If the user running the command doesn’t have write permissions to the working directory, the file is created in the user’s home directory.

=======================
what happends when we source a file ?

Sourcing a file is nothing but executing the file, more importantly making the changes of the file applicable in the current shell itself, the shell which we are working in. Usually, when we execute a command or a script, a new sub-shell is created and the script is executed in the sub-shell. Due to this, if the script or the command intends to make any change to the current shell, it will not happen. In order to make the changes applicable in the current shell itself, we "source" the file.

 Let us take an example to understand this by writing a script to change the current directory to temp.
$ cat a.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash

cd temp
Check the current directory before running the script:
$ pwd
/home/guru
Let us run the script:
$ ./a.sh
/home/guru/temp
After running the script,  the current directory is:
$ pwd
/home/guru
  As seen above, it is clear that the command is indeed executed in a sub-shell, not in the main shell itself. That is the reason why the change is effected in the sub-shell, and not in the shell from which the script is invoked. In fact, we could have also proved this by checking the process id of the shell script which should have been different from the process id of our home shell.

  To make this change permanent in our current shell is what we use the source command for:
$ source a.sh
Now, let us check the current directory after sourcing the script:
$ pwd
/home/guru/temp
      This is the meaning of sourcing of a file.

source : https://www.theunixschool.com/2012/04/what-is-sourcing-file.html

====================
What is the difference between the sourcing and executing of a file?
     
The difference between sourcing and executing a file is : executing a file does not make any changes in the current shell, if intended, whereas the sourced file makes the changes in the current shell itself.
	 
===================
difference between adding variable in export and .profile?

export makes a variable something that will be included in child process environments. It does not affect other already existing environments. In general there isn't a way to set a variable in one terminal and have it automatically appear in another terminal

Adding it to your .profile makes it so that your environment will be setup to include that new variable each time you log in though. So it's not being exported from one shell to another, but instead is instructing a new shell to include it when it sets up the initial environment.

Umask

File : /etc/bashrc

For example, let’s calculate how a new file or directory permission will affect because of umask.

Files: 666 - 022 = 644. According to the permission, the owner can read and execute the file. Groups and others can read the file. 
Directory: 777 - 022 = 755. This means the owner will have all read, write permission and cd to the directory. Group and others can read and list the contents of the directory and cd to the directory. 
You can also view the umask value in numeric form by executing below command.

$umask
Output:

u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx

single quote and double quote meaning in unix

the single quotes will literally echo what you have between them, while the double quotes will evaluate variables between them and output the value of the variable.

a=apple      # a simple variable
arr=(apple)  # an indexed array with a single element
	

# | Expression  | Result      | Comments
---+-------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | "$a"        | apple       | variables are expanded inside ""
 2 | '$a'        | $a          | variables are not expanded inside ''
 3 | "'$a'"      | 'apple'     | '' has no special meaning inside ""
 4 | '"$a"'      | "$a"        | "" is treated literally inside ''
 5 | '\''        | **invalid** | can not escape a ' within ''; use "'" or $'\'' (ANSI-C quoting)
 6 | "red$arocks"| red         | $arocks does not expand $a; use ${a}rocks to preserve $a
 7 | "redapple$" | redapple$   | $ followed by no variable name evaluates to $
 8 | '\"'        | \"          | \ has no special meaning inside ''
 9 | "\'"        | \'          | \' is interpreted inside "" but has no significance for '
10 | "\""        | "           | \" is interpreted inside ""
11 | "*"         | *           | glob does not work inside "" or ''
12 | "\t\n"      | \t\n        | \t and \n have no special meaning inside "" or ''; use ANSI-C quoting
13 | "`echo hi`" | hi          | `` and $() are evaluated inside ""
14 | '`echo hi`' | `echo hi`   | `` and $() are not evaluated inside ''
15 | '${arr[0]}' | ${arr[0]}   | array access not possible inside ''
16 | "${arr[0]}" | apple       | array access works inside ""
17 | $'$a\''     | $a'         | single quotes can be escaped inside ANSI-C quoting
18 | "$'\t'"     | $'\t'       | ANSI-C quoting is not interpreted inside ""
19 | '!cmd'      | !cmd        | history expansion character '!' is ignored inside ''

process management
what are differenet process stat
1) D : Uninterruptible sleep ( usually IO)
take example of backup process, here trying to write some data to disk but bcoz of some reason disk is not responding in this case process will wait for some time and then it will go to D state

2) R : this is a state where process is either running or ready to run

3) S : Interuptible sleep ( waiting for an event to complete)

4) T : stopped
once the process is completed this state occurs , this process can be restarted

5) Z : Defunct(zombie) : in case parent process is killed by someone ( by mistakely) . in this case all its child prcess becomes zombie.

performance monitoring
1) CPU
1.1 contenxt switch :
when cpu switches from one process to another process then it is callled context switch , higher level of context siwtching can cause performance issue.


1.2 run queue:
run queue indicates active no of proess in current queue for cpu
when cpu is ready to execute a process, it picks up from run queue based on priority
processes in sleep state or io wait are not in run queue
so higher no of process in run queue can cause performance issue.

1.3 cpu utilization
this indicates how much of cpu is currently utilized
100 % of cpu utilization means system is fully loaded , so this can cause performance issues

1.4 load average
this indicates average cpu load over specific period of time
load average is calculated  by combining both total no of process in queue  and total no of uninterruptable task  status

2) Memory
2.1) IO
io wait is amount of time cpu is waiting for io. if u see consistent high io wait on system , it indicates a problem with disk system

you should also monitor read/second and write/second. this is measured in blocks. i. e. no of read/write per second.

tps indicates total txn per second which is sum of read tps and write tps.

what is load average in top command
https://www.site24x7.com/blog/load-average-what-is-it-and-whats-the-best-load-average-for-your-linux-servers#:~:text=The%20load%20average%20is%20the,a%20defined%20period%20of%20time.&text=Typically%2C%20the%20top%20or%20the,%2C%20five%2C%20and%2015%20minutes.

Before getting into how to measure the load average output and what each of these values mean, let's get into the simplest example: a server with a single core processor. 

Breaking down the load

A server with a single core processor is like a single line of customers waiting to get their items billed in a grocery store. During peak hours, there is usually a long line and the waiting time for every individual is also high. 

If you're the cashier and want to record the waiting time, one important metric would be the number of people waiting during a particular period of time. If there are no customers waiting, then the wait time is zero. On the other hand, if there is a long line of customers, then the wait time is high. 

Applying that to the load average output (0.5, 1.5, 3.0) that we got above: 

0.5 means the minimum waiting time at the counter. Between 0.00 and 1.0, there is no need to worry. Your servers are safe!
1.5 means the queue is filling up. If the average gets any higher, things are going to start slowing down.
3.00 means there's a considerably long queue waiting, and an extra resource/counter is required to clear up the queue faster. 

What you want is a queue/load average value between 0.00 and 1.00. So can we conclude that the ideal load average is 1.00, and anything above that is an action call to troubleshoot? Well, although it's a safe bet, a more proactive approach is leaving some extra headroom to manage unexpected loads.

Multicores and multiprocessors to the rescue

Are a single quad core processor and a server with four processors (with one core each) the same? Relatively, yes. The main difference between multicore and multiprocessor is that the former refers to a single CPU having multiple cores, while the latter refers to multiple CPUs. To sum up: one quad core is equal to two dual cores which is equal to four single cores.

The load average is relative to the number of cores available in the server and not how they are spread out over CPUs. This means the maximum utilization range is 0-1 for a single core, 0-2 for a dual core, 0-4 for a quad core, 0-8 for an octa-core, and so on. 

Referring to the cashier example again, a load of 1.00 would mean the capacity is just right on a single core processor; while on a dual core processor, a load of 1.50 would mean one line is filled up, and the other line is filling up. Similarly, a load of 5.00 on a quad core processor is something to worry about, while on an octa-core processor, 5.00 is only just filling up, and there is optimum space available.
