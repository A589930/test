Kernel Panic 
Reasons:
1) after fresh istallation or after kernel upgrade followd by reboot
2) Kernel isnot isntalled properly

Solution
1) during splash screen rescue mode is shown, select that and press enter
2)You will get the terminal , get kernel version with "uname -r" command
3) we need to create a initrd image with mkinitrd command, mkinitrd --help
mkinitrd -f "image name with kernel  version" "kernel version obtained from uname -r command"
you can also use dracut command
4) systemctl reboot
